32x32x1 -> magic -> 10x1 probs ig
mse
sigmoid (maybe try w others)

archs:
- multi out perceptron ie no hidden, alph = 4^i for i in [0,4]Z
- vary depth in [1,4]Z and 64 units, alph = 1
- 2 hidden (256units, 64units), alpha = 4^i for i in [-3,1]Z

3F CV based on misclass

init weights indep from unif [-1,1]R

run for max 1000 iters, but 50 iters with 2k datapoints on 4x512 layers takes 1 min
